# Power Automate - Custom Connector C# Scripting
An example repo for you to build custom code to run in a Power Automate connector

## What does it do?
Power Automate allows code to be ran at run time. The official documentation is [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/custom-connectors/write-code). This C# code can run a subset of commands to do some powerful things during Power Automate Flow runtimes to bridge any gaps in the platform.
